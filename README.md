# ECON526
A repositories for all the coding in R I did for ECON526, and some possible future extensions:

Quite rightfully, as described by Professor Marmer, that Econometrics as a very practical subject, need coding for effecrtive actual implementations. 
So I decide that I would not do very wrong with collecting and organizating the programming material of the work I have done for this course, both for
the purpose of reminding myself and helping myself with R programming by allowing the review of previous work in an organized manner, and also enabling
extension upon previous parts as well as discussions.

Going forward, I will attempt to code the same material, espcially the more computational exercises, **in Julia instead of R**, to get a feeling that how these 
two languages compare to each other. I will also try to come up with my own projects which simulates large datasets and regressions upon large datasets.
